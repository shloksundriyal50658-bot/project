<h1> Portfolio Risk & Diversification Analysis</h1>

<p>
This project evaluates the structure and performance of a 38-stock portfolio, highlighting sectoral risks, concentration issues, and diversification opportunities. The analysis provides actionable insights to strengthen stability and improve long-term returns.
</p>

<h2> Key Findings</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sector Tilt:</strong> Heavy exposure to the Financial sector (73%), creating sector-specific risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Banking Dominance:</strong> Holdings are concentrated in banking stocks, increasing correlated risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Concentration Risk:</strong> A small number of stocks contribute disproportionately to profits.</li>
  <li><strong>Diversification Gap:</strong> Limited exposure to technology, healthcare, and consumer goods reduces resilience against volatility.</li>
  <li><strong>Downside Risk:</strong> Current structure may amplify losses during sector downturns.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reallocate capital from underperformers (e.g., <strong>PCJEWELLER</strong>, <strong>SHRIRAMFIN</strong>) to high-yield sectors like Financials and Consumer Discretionary.</li>
  <li>Monitor exposure to <strong>BAJFINANCE</strong> and <strong>TATAMOTORS</strong> to avoid overconcentration.</li>
  <li>Diversify across multiple sectors and asset classes to strengthen portfolio stability and improve risk-adjusted returns.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Portfolio Health</h2>
<p>
Out of <strong>38 stocks</strong>, <strong>34 are profitable</strong> and only <strong>4 are loss-making</strong>. The portfolio is broadly healthy, but trimming underperformers could further boost net returns.
</p>

<h2> Tools & Techniques</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis</li>
  <li>Sector Allocation & Risk Assessment</li>
  <li>Concentration & Diversification Metrics</li>
  <li>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) & Excel</li>
</ul>

<h2> Outcome</h2>
<p>
This project demonstrates the ability to perform <strong>end-to-end portfolio analysis</strong>, identify risks, and provide <strong>strategic recommendations</strong> for improved performance and resilience.
