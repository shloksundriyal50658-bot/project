Aim was to analyze a client’s stock portfolio to identify monthly investment patterns, assess risk exposure, and deliver actionable insights through interactive dashboards and reports.

Project Overview - The project involved collecting real-time financial data, cleaning and organizing portfolio information, performing exploratory,risk analysis and visualizing the results.

Problem Statement - Investors often lack a clear and consolidated view of portfolio performance, sector exposure, diversity in his portfolio and risk distribution. This project builds a system that delivers real-time insights, highlights concentration and diversification in his portfolio and supports informed investment decisions

Tools Used - Python(Data extraction, cleaning, and analysis) , Power BI(Dashboard creation and visualization)

Methods Used in the Project - Data cleaning and preprocessing,Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),Portfolio performance analysis,Risk analysis,KPI calculation,Data modeling for BI reporting

Insights - The portfolio is heavily concentrated in the financial sector with banking stocks dominating and creating correlated risk. A few holdings drive most profits while limited exposure to other industries reduces diversification and resilience. Although 34 of 38 stocks are profitable, underperformers like PCJEWELLER and SHRIRAMFIN should be trimmed and care taken to avoid overexposure to BAJFINANCE and TATAMOTORS. A more balanced allocation across sectors would strengthen stability and improve long‑term returns.
